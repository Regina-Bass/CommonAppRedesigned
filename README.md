# Common App Redesigned
### by Regina Bass, Amy Tan, Victoria Barbessi, Michelle Neira

Inclusivity is a design opportunity, and an essential part of the design process is ensuring we’re designing for more people than just ourselves. Inclusion starts with being aware of those that might have challenges accessing your app or use it differently, and extends all the way to you remaining cognizant of how your app portrays people.

If you aren’t approaching design with intent to be as inclusive as possible, it’s time to reconsider. It won’t happen automatically, and by default, you’re likely to make assumptions based on your own worldview and biases.
